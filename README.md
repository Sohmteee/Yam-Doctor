# Yam Doctor

**Yam Doctor** is an expert system designed to diagnose diseases in yams. By utilizing advanced machine learning through the Google Gemini API, Yam Doctor can analyze photos and text descriptions of yams to identify potential diseases or confirm the health of the yam.

## Features

- **Image Analysis**: Upload a photo of a yam, and Yam Doctor will analyze it to detect any signs of disease.
- **Text Description**: Describe the appearance of the yam using text, and Yam Doctor will provide a diagnosis based on the description.
- **Expert System**: The app is specialized in yam diseases and provides expert advice tailored specifically to yams.
- **Dual Input Support**: Users can use either or both input methods (image and text) to get a diagnosis.
- **Google Gemini API Integration**: The app leverages the powerful Google Gemini API to generate accurate and reliable responses.

## How It Works

1. **Select an Image**: Users can take a photo of the yam or select an existing image from their gallery.
2. **Describe the Yam**: Alternatively, or additionally, users can describe what the yam looks like, including any visible signs of disease.
3. **Get a Diagnosis**: Yam Doctor processes the input and responds with a probable diagnosis of any diseases or confirms that the yam is healthy.
